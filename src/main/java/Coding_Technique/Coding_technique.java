/*                                           Coding Techniques and Best Practices


    ○ Complying with coding style is crucial

                   * you will always work in a team

    ○ Good code

                   * is not the one, computers understand;

                   * it is the one, humans can understand


                                             Code, in general, can be organized in several ways


    1. good practice implies

                   * you will choose the version that will be easiest to read and understand


    2. assumption:

                   * at your workplace, you will always type code cleanly

                                 – as simple as possible,

                                 - perfectly organized,

                                 - maintaining a steady logical flow



   3. Clean code is a code that is

                  * focused

                  * and understandable,

                                - which means it must be

                                              • readable,

                                              • logical

                                              • and changeable.


    4. When assigning names to

                  * variables

                  * or SQL objects,

          always chose

                  * shorter,

                  * meaningful names,

                                - pronounceable, where one word per concept has been picked

                  * conveying specific information

          Names will constitute more than 80% of your code.


    5. Readability

                 * horizontal and vertical organization of code

                 * colour

                               - use ad-hoc software that re-organizes code and colours
                                    different words consistently

                               - use the relevant analogical tool provided in Workbench

                 * time is a factor

                 * unification of coding style is a top-priority

                               - it is unprofessional to merge code written in the same language

                               - but in a different style

                 * intervene manually and adjust your code as you like


    6. Comments

                * lines of text that Workbench will not run as code;

                * they convey a message to someone who reads our code

                *    /* …            (for large comments)

                    # or --          (for one-line comments)
