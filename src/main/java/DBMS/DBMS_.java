    ○ Database Management Systems (DBMS)

                   * are software systems used

                                 - to store,

                                 - retrieve,

                                 - and run queries on data.

    ○ A DBMS

                  * serves as an interface between an end-user and a database,

                  * allowing users to

                                - create,

                                - read,

                                - update,

                                - and delete

         data in the database.

    ○ DBMS manage

                  * the data,

                  * the database engine,

                  *  and the database schema,

        allowing for data to be manipulated or extracted by users and other programs. This helps provide

                  *  data security,

                  * data integrity,

                  * concurrency,

                  * and uniform data

        administration procedures.

    ○ DBMS optimizes

                  * the organization of data

                                - by following a database schema design technique called

                                              • normalization,

            which splits a large table into smaller tables when any of its attributes have redundancy in values.

    ○ DBMS offer many benefits over traditional file systems, including

                 * flexibility

                 * and a more complex backup system.

    ○ Database management systems can be classified based on a variety of criteria such as:

                * the data model,

                * the database distribution,

                * or user numbers.


                                        The most widely used types of DBMS software are


    1. Relational:

                * Relational database management systems (RDBMS)

                              - are the most popular data model

                                            • because of its user-friendly interface.

                      It is based on normalizing data in the rows and columns of the tables.
                      This is a viable option when you need a data storage system that is

                               - scalable,

                               - flexible,

                               - and able to manage lots of information.

    2. Distributed:

                * A distributed DBMS is a set of

                               - logically interrelated databases distributed over a network

                       that is managed by a

                                - centralized database application.

                        This type of DBMS

                                  - synchronizes data periodically

                                  - and ensures that any change to data is universally updated in the database.

    3. Hierarchical:

                * Hierarchical databases organize model data

                                  - in a tree-like structure.

                          Data storage is

                                    - either a top-down

                                    - or bottom-up format and is represented using a parent-child relationship.

    4. Object-oriented:

                  * Object-oriented models

                                      - store data in objects instead of rows and columns.

                           It is based on object-oriented programming (OOP)

                                       - that allows objects to have members such as

                                                     • fields,

                                                     • properties,

                                                     • and methods.

    5. Network

                 * The network database model

                               - addresses the need for more complex relationships

                               - by allowing each child to have multiple parents.

                * Entities are organized in a graph

                                - that can be accessed through several paths.
