    ○ The SQL tool that allow us to construct

                   * a relationship between objects

    ○ A join shows a result set,

                   * containing fields derived from two or more tables

    ○ We must find a related column from the two tables

                   * that contains the same type of data

                   * we will be free to add columns from these two tables to our output
