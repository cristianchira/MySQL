/*                             SQL Declarative Language


    ○ SQL is a declarative programming language

                * This means while coding you will not be interested in

                            - how you want the job done.

                 * The focus is on

                             - what results you want to obtain.

          The algorithms are built-in, and there is an optimizer,

                  * which will separate your task into smaller steps

                  * and do the magic to bring the desired output.

           When using SQL,

                  * you should concentrate on what you want to retrieve from your databases.

    ○ SQL is the programming language

                * you need to execute commands that let you

                            - create and manipulate a relational database.


                            Main components of SQL's syntax

    1.Data Definition Language (known as DDL),

    2.Data Manipulation Language (abbreviated DML),

    3. Data Control Language (DCL),
