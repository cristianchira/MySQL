    ○ Data value

                *  A data value is the specific piece of information stored in a particular cell

                            - at the intersection of a row and a column.

                * They are the actual content that is organized and managed by the

                            - database management system (DBMS).

         Data values can be of various types, such as

                 * numbers,

                 * text,

                 * dates,

                 * or even multimedia content like images and audio files.

    ○ A record

                 * is each entry that exists in a table.

                 * It corresponds to a row of the table.

                 * all data value forms a record

    ○ A column

                 * represents a specific attribute or field of that record(row)

                 * containing specific information about every record in the table.

    ○ Relational database

                 * a few related tables

    ○ Entity

                 * the smallest unit that can contain a meaningful set of data

         rows represent

                 * the horizontal entity in the table,

          columns

                 * its vertical entity.

          A single row of a table, being a single occurrence of that entity, can be also called

                 * an entity instance.

    ○ Table

                * is a big data entity on its own
