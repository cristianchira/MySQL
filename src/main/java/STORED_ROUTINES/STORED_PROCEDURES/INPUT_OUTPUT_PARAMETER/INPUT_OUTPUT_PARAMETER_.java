/*                                    INPUT OUTPUT PARAMETER


    ○  You should also be aware that

                    * IN-OUT parameters exist as well.

    ○ They are used whenever you are working with stored procedures and trying TO OVERRIDE

                   * the content of a data point that has been used as an INPUT

                   * with the OUTPUT value obtained after running the calculation.


    ○ This means you are having the same variable

                    * as an IN

                    * and an OUT

            parameter.
