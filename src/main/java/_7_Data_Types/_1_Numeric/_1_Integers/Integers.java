   1. TINYINT:

                 * 1 byte, can be signed or unsigned

    2. SMALLINT:

                * 2 bytes, can be signed or unsigned

   3. MEDIUMINT:

                 * 3 bytes, can be signed or unsigned

    4.INTEGER and INT:

                * 4 bytes, can be signed or unsigned

    5. BIGINT:

                 * 8 bytes, can be signed or unsigned


    â—‹ All are signed by default.

                * If you want to create an unsigned column of any of these data types,  ------------------

                * you need to include the UNSIGNED keyword in the column definition.

        For example:

                * CREATE TABLE example (
                  id TINYINT UNSIGNED,
                  ...
                  );
