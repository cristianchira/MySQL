/*                                           The CHAR and VARCHAR Types


    ○ CHAR and VARCHAR are two character data types used to store string values in a relational database.

                * They differ primarily in the way they store and handle the data.


                             Here is an explanation of the CHAR and VARCHAR types:


    1. CHAR:

                * The CHAR data type is used to store fixed-length character strings.

        When you define a CHAR column,

                * you need to specify the maximum length of the strings that can be stored in that column,

        for example, CHAR(10).

                * The length is fixed, meaning that when you store a string shorter than the defined length,

                            - it is automatically padded with trailing spaces to match the defined length.

                * Conversely, if you try to store a string longer than the defined length,

                            - it will be truncated.

         CHAR is generally more efficient when storing strings that have a consistent length.


    2. VARCHAR:

                * The VARCHAR data type is used to store variable-length character strings.

        Like CHAR,

                * you need to specify the maximum length of the strings that can be stored in a VARCHAR column,

        for example, VARCHAR(255).

                * However, unlike CHAR, VARCHAR does not pad shorter strings with trailing spaces.

                * Instead, it only uses as much storage space as the length of the actual string value

                            - plus some overhead for length information.

        VARCHAR is typically

                * more efficient when storing strings with varying lengths.

    ○ In summary,

                * use CHAR for fixed-length character strings

                * and VARCHAR for variable-length strings.

        Keep in mind that the performance difference between the two types is usually minimal,

                * so choose the type that best suits your data requirements.
