/*                                                    DUPLICATE RECORDS


    ○ duplicate records, also known as duplicate rows,

                   * are identical rows in an SQL table

                   * for a pair of duplicate records, the values in each column coincide

    ○ duplicate rows are not always allowed in a database or a data table

                   * they are sometimes encountered, especially in

                                 - new,

                                 - raw,

                                 - or uncontrolled data


                                   Here’s how to handle duplicates:

            The regular practice of many companies is to

                    * clean their data from such occurrences.

    ○ GROUP BY

                  * the field that differs most among records!
