/*                                             JOINs


    ○ is the SQL tool that allow us to construct

                   * a relationship between objects

    ○ A join shows a result set,

                   * containing fields derived from two or more tables

    ○ We must find a related column from the two tables

                   * that contains the same type of data

                   * we will be free to add columns from these two tables to our output

            The columns you use to relate tables must represent

                   * the same object such as ID,

                   * but the tables you are considering

                               - NEED NOT be logically adjacent in the relational schema.   ----------

             What is important is

                               - to find a related column connecting the two tables.
