/*                                                Database


    ○ is an organized collection of structured information, or data,

                * typically stored electronically in a computer system.


                                What we need for create a proper Database


    1. DataBase designer

                  * What do database designers actually do?

                                - They plot the entire database system on a canvas using a visualization tool.

                                 - There are two main ways to do that.

                                               1. One is drawing an entity relationship diagram,

                                                            - an E.R. diagram for brief.

                                               2. Another form of representation of a database is

                                                             - the Relational Schema.

                                                                         • It represents a table in the shape
                                                                               of a rectangle.

                                                                          • The name of the table is at the top
                                                                                of the rectangle.

                                                                           • The column names are listed below.

                                                              - All relational schemas in a database form
                                                                    the database schema. ----------------------

    2. Database Creation

                 * use SQL to set up database physically


    3. Database Management

                 * DataBase design +  Database Creation +  Database manipulation = database management


    4. Database administration:

                  * refers to the whole set of activities performed by a database administrator
                        to ensure that a database is

                                - always available as needed.

                                -  database security,

                                 - database monitoring and troubleshooting,

                                 - and planning for future growth.
