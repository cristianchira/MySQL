    ○ It will allow us to

                   * set a condition upon which we will specify

                   * what part of the data we want to retrieve from the database


                                             WHERE  query


    1. SELECT column_1, column_2,… column_n

       FROM table_name;

       WHERE condition;

                   * This condition can be, for example,

                                  - a verification that certain information is available,

                                  - a check

                                  - or a mathematical expression.


                                       Example
